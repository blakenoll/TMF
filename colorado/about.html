<p>Welcome to The Master's Fellowship of Colorado (TMFCO)!</p>

<p>We are a network of pastors in Colorado who are committed to the faithful exposition and proclamation of God's Word. Our purpose as pastors is to be bound together by love for the living Word, the Master, our Lord Jesus, the church for which he died, and the bold proclamation of the exposited written Word! The Fellowship's purpose is to support the mission and leadership of the local church here in Colorado by connecting and networking like-minded pastors and missionaries who share core biblical convictions of doctrine and praxis.</p>

<p>Our vision at TMFCO is to provide local pastoral strengthening, an online community, and a practical partnership for ministry in Colorado. If you are looking for a brotherhood of pastors, this is it!</p>

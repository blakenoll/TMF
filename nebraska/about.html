About TMF Nebraska

We are a network of pastors in Nebraska committed to the expository proclamation of God's Word. This fellowship is bound together by a firm belief in the inerrancy and sufficiency of Scripture. Through the mutual support of pastoral fellowship, our mission is to strengthen the leadership of like-minded local churches in Nebraska.

Our vision for TMFNE is to forge an online community and to host in-person gatherings for encouragement, accountability, and equipping; so that each of us may fulfill the shepherding ministry entrusted to us by Christ, our Savior and Master.

For additional information, feel free to contact the leaders for this TMF chapter.

intro:
- excerpt: The Master’s Fellowship is an association of pastors and missionaries bound
    together by love for the Living Word, The Master, our Lord Jesus, the church for
    which He died, and the bold proclamation of the exposited written word. The Fellowship’s
    purpose is to support the mission and leadership of the local church by connecting
    and networking like-minded pastors and missionaries who share core biblical convictions
    of doctrine and praxis.
